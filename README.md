# Aderyns-Cradle-Multiplayer-Maps
Ten multiplayer maps I created for the video game Aderyn's Cradle by Mojo Game Studios (Full time: January 2016 - July 2016, part time: ongoing).

As Aderyn's Cradle is still being worked on, I cannot post the levels for direct download. However, the videos I have posted show off the entirety of each level.

While working for Mojo Game Studios as a level designer, I was tasked with creating a suite of multiplayer maps for the game Aderyn's Cradle. These maps were all designed to fit the core mechanics of the game's multiplay matches: short rounds of small teams with varying objectives. The levels are situated across the Aderyn's Cradle world with unique environments designed to fit each of the zones of that world.
